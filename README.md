# Rugby Portfolio Analytics

Predicting player performance with machine learning and portfolio optimization.

## Description

This project applies machine learning to predict rugby player performance and uses portfolio optimization theory to select optimal team compositions. By treating players as financial assets with expected returns (performance) and risk (volatility), we build a data-driven framework for strategic team selection.

**Dataset:** [Stats best rugby player 2023/2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pierrejeanne/stats-best-rugby-player-20232024) - 100 top professional players with 30+ performance features.

## Objectives

- Predict future player performance using historical statistics
- Compare 4 ML regression models (Linear, Ridge, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Optimize team selection balancing predicted performance and risk
- Visualize insights through performance distributions

## Technologies

- **Python 3.10+**
- pandas, NumPy (data processing)
- scikit-learn (machine learning)
- scipy (optimization)
- matplotlib, seaborn (visualization)
- pytest (testing)

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
